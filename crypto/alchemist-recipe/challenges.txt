an alchemist claims to have a recipe to transform lead into gold. 
however, he accidentally encrypted it with a peculiar process of his own. 
he left behind his notes on the encryption method and an encrypted sample. 
unfortunately, he spilled some magic ink on the notes, making them weirdly formatted. 
the notes include comments showing how he encrypted his recipe. 
can you find his golden secret?
